Description
Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row.
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 56981

flag: picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_C85AF58A}

the strstr function only finds a substring and dont match the entire string, so if you play rockpaperscissors you allways win
