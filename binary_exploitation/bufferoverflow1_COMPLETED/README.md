Description
Control the return address
Now we're cooking! You can overflow the buffer and return to the flag function in the program.
You can view source here. And connect with it using nc saturn.picoctf.net 65151

flag: picoCTF{addr3ss3s_ar3_3asy_c76b273b}

With this one i learned a lot!!!
First I tried to see the offset of char's that break the return address
Then, I use readelf -s vuln to see where the binary address of the win function
After that I wrote a python script to send the necessary data to the program and got the flag
