DESCRIPTION

Smash the stack
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer?

nc saturn.picoctf.net 51110



flag: picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_8ba275ff}

Analizing the c code provided we can see that we have a signal to handle segfaults (buffer_overflows)
So, is just run the program, write a string with more length that the buffer size and get the flag
