Description
Can you get the flag?
Here's the website.
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?


flag: picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}

So the file lives at /usr/share/nginx/html/, so i just did (../)*flag.txt to see in with path I have permission to acess it
