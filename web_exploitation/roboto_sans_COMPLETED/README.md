Description
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.

flag: picoCTF{Who_D03sN7_L1k5_90B0T5_032f1c2b}

The name of the challange reminds me of the robots.txt that is a file that gives specific orders to search engine robots like control acess to some weboages, file images, etc

By acessing the robots.txt file of this site I saw 2 urls that href nothing and a base64 string, that when decoded it gaves an url of the flag
