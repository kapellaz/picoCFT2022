Description:

A new modular challenge!
Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. Then map to the following character set: 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore.
Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format

flag: picoCTF{1NV3R53LY_H4RD_8A05D939}

Use of the converter.py function from basic-mod1 and adapt to the new level
Use of the python's pow function to find the modular inverse
